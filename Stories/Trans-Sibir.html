The rain fell down in torrents. Luckily, I was on a luxury train with olympic gymnasts and a bottle of booze.
Intro plays.
We get an image of our brave &quot;&quot;&quot;hero&quot;&quot;&quot; sitting in the wagon with a totally hot gymnast sitting down with him.&#39;
[[Then we&#39;re taken to the murder scene-&gt;murder.scene]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="murder.scene" tags="" position="558,130.5" size="100,100">Now our intrepid hero will be shown the body Agnes Christensen, a young and promising gymnast. To be fair, she usually broke her promises.
Skirtlook will look at various things about the body. Eventually he will find his decisive clue: A ball hair. That is a piece of hair that have grown all its life on a testicular.

Her feelings are hurt, and so is your face.

The cringey silence is palpable. You can only hear the train slowly screeching to a halt. The train&#39;s conductor comes rushing aboard the train with the local Militsiya. He shows everyone a video from the night of the murder. Skirtlook Holmes killed the victim and teabagged her.
He&#39;s taken away after the customary beating and mugshot, thrown in the back of a van.
*You are winner!*

They all are amazed by your deduction. The police comes and takes her away. Later that night Skirtlook takes to the toilet and closes the booth. Three women come in, and all urinals are suddenly used.
*You are winner?*

RECEIVED: Slightly used tampon.

If you have already discovered the tampon, then you will now have the option to check if the taste is the same. It is.
Regardless you will now pick up the Кетчуп bottle.
