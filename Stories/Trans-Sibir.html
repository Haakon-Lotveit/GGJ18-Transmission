Skirtlook will look at various things about the body. Eventually he will find his decisive clue: A ball hair. That is a piece of hair that have grown all its life on a testicular.

He&#39;s taken away after the customary beating and mugshot, thrown in the back of a van.

She finally mutters that she was reading. What was she reading? She was reading about reading ^^about woodwordking^^
What?
Woodworking.
As it turns out, Alex is from a small Transnistrian village where they made bird houses during the communist era, using timber imported from Siberia, they would make bird houses for the glory of the Soviet Union. Even after the wall fell they kept it up for their own sakes, and now there are more bird houses than people houses. It&#39;s just a thing. Besides, lots of girls like wood working. For example, Sam said that she loves getting wood too!

She has always loved woodworking. The feel of solid wood in her hand, and her ability to shape it and manipulate it has always filled her with happiness.
She swears she only buys the magazine for the articles. The pictures of Hunky Harry and Absman Abe is just a bonus.
Okay? Well, you&#39;re glad you&#39;ve cleared that up. Do you want to [[ask her more questions-&gt;talk.to.alex]], or do you want to [[do something else-&gt;train.car]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="alex.penis" tags="" position="356,535" size="100,100">Alex is indignant about this question. She would never buy a dildo, because steel and silicone are not merely inferior material (She&#39;d probably build railroad tracks in oak if she could figure out how), but it&#39;s also a poor replacement for the real thing. When asked if she has a real one, she just look at you as if you&#39;re an idiot and tells you that yes, she does have a boyfriend, and that you&#39;re being a creep.

Maybe you should [[ask her something else-&gt;talk.to.alex]], or maybe do [[do something else-&gt;train.car]] entirely

The pain is sharp and immediate. 
In the oncoming storm of exquisite verbal abuse, sounding very much like the what you&#39;d hear in the cheapest sailor-taverns in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. In fact the way she called you a &quot;[[бесплодный карлик-&gt;translate.infertile.dwarf]]&quot;, sounds like an old flame in those younger seafaring ways.

*Warning!* Do not take more than 3 pills per day, or your lower bowel movements will go unopposed. You will soil yourself, or be stuck on a toilet for the rest of the day. You have been warned. In order to prevent people accidentally swallowing these, we have made them taste like fine mocha. Nobody likes mocha, so according to Legal, this is sufficient.

Then she stands very still, excuses herself and with a speed only seen in cartoons, runs from the seat to the women&#39;s toilet and locks herself in the women&#39;s bathroom.
If you *have* inspected the bathroom before: &quot;Блядь!Блядь!Блядь!&quot; and other things we will not translate from Russian to preserve our age ratings are heard before there is embarassing silence and everyone does their best to pretend that nothin has happened.

If you *have* *not* insepcted the bathroom before: &quot;Блядь!Блядь!Блядь!&quot; and other things we will not translate from Russian to preserve our age ratings are heard. Then there&#39;s a second scream. It contains words like &quot;Сука&quot; and similar. In between the impolite language you can hear that someone left the toilet seat up... But why would they do that? Women don&#39;t do that... Do they? Or maybe... the killer was the last one to use the toilet before the murder!
You should now [[go back-&gt;train.car]] and do something else.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
